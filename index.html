        <p>I've been learning how to format webpages first and foremost and I've reached the point that I'm fairly good at getting things where I want them to be! I can easily make all sorts of things like headers, footers and asides.</p>

        The thing I mainly love about coding is the analysis of data flow and the understanding of all the little webs that makeup any webpage. All of the tiny little threads connecting back and forth to one another to make a page ultimately look the way it does! Even a small page like this contains a lot of code!
